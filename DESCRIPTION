Description: Semi-parametric approach for sparse canonical correlation analysis 
    which can handle mixed data types: continuous, binary and truncated continuous.
    Bridge functions are provided to connect Kendall's tau to latent correlation
    under the Gaussian copula model. The methods are described in 
    Yoon, Carroll and Gaynanova (2020) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa007> and 
    Yoon, Müller and Gaynanova (2020) <arXiv:2006.13875>.
